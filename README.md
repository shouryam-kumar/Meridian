# Cryptocurrency Market Prediction System

A system for analyzing cryptocurrency market data and making price predictions. I built this as a small weekend project to exploe more about the Coingeck API and different prediction models which are easy to implement. This  Project is not maintained and should not be used for predicting the prices of crytocurrencies.


**Caution**: Since free version of coingecko API allows only a few refresh rates every fixed interval, there might be blank screen when you exceeed this. Please wait for sometime and refresh again. 

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
    ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```
   streamlit run app/main.py
   ```

## Features

- Historical cryptocurrency data analysis
